Selection Sort: Define the Algorithm, Implement on Linked list
Algorithm works in this way: find the size of the array, 
finds the largest item in the list, 
swaps that item with the item in the last place in the list,
searches for the largest item by not taking into count the last item in the list
process continues until only 1 item is left, which means n-1 swapped
algorithm ends

# Program
this program should ask the user to input numbers and 
it should save them in linked list then 
it should sort them with using selection sort
